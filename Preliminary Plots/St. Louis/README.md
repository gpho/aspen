## Preliminary Plots for St. Louis

**Goal for 4/27:** make preliminary visualizations of food access, internet access, and unemployment in St. Louis
+ By geographical location
+ By demographic group (age / race)

Make a copy of `prelim_plots_stl.ipynb` to use as a template.

We will start with a different exploratory notebook per data source, and will combine later.


### Data sources used
[St. Louis Neighborhoods](https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/data/datasets/dataset.cfm?id=85)
You will need all of the file formats in order to utilize the map in geopandas, but the only one you need to open is the shp. The tl_2017_29_tract.shp is the map with the tracts while the BND_Nhd88_cw.shp is the neighborhood/wards files.
